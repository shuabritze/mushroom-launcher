# Mushroom Launcher

A launcher for a certain mushroom game.

Installation:
1. Download the latest release here: https://github.com/shuabritze/mushroom-launcher/releases
2. Install the launcher
3. Open the launcher and select your existing MS2 install location OR select a new empty folder to download the client files to.
4. (optional) If you need to install the client, click on Install and wait for the command window to finish (May take a while to download 13gb~)
5. After downloading or selecting the install folder, click on Patch, this will add Maple2.dll to your installation
6. Add a new server (ip, port, and name in order)
7. Select the server by clicking on it then click on Launch
8. Maple away!

Once you launch a server for the first time, you can skip the launcher by directly running MapleStory2.exe in the x64 folder, as the configuration persists.
